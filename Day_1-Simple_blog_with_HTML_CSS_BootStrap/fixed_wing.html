      <p style="font-size: 20px;">Multi Rotor drones are the most common types of drones which are used by professionals and hobbyists alike. They are used for most common applications like aerial photography, aerial video surveillanceÂ etc. Different types of products are available in this segment in the market – say multi-rotor drones for professional uses like aerial photography (whose price may range from 500USD to 3K USD) and there are lots of variants for hobby purposes like amateur drone racing, or leisure flying (price range from 50USD to 400USD). Out of all the 4 drone types (based on aerial platform), multi-rotor drones are the easiest to manufacture and they are the cheapest option available as well. A multirotor[1] or multicopter is a rotorcraft with more than two rotors. An advantage of multirotor aircraft is the simpler rotor mechanics required for flight control. Unlike single- and double-rotor helicopters which use complex variable pitch rotors whose pitch varies as the blade rotates for flight stability and control, multirotors often use fixed-pitch blades; control of vehicle motion is achieved by varying the relative speed of each rotor to change the thrust and torque produced by each. 
          Due to their ease of both construction and control, multirotor aircraft are frequently used in radio control aircraft and UAV projects[2][3][4][5][6][7] in which the names tricopter, quadcopter, hexacopter and octocopter are frequently used to refer to 3-, 4-, 6- and 8-rotor rotorcraft, respectively.
          Hexacopter. In order to allow more power and stability at reduced weight, coaxial rotors can be employed, in which each arm has two motors, running in opposite directions (one facing up and one facing down).[10] 
          Also possible is the addition of horizontal propellers[11][12][13] These types of rotorcraft (which have just 4 vertical propellers) are called quadplanes[14]. </p>
      <p style="font-size: 20px;">Multi-rotor drones can be further classified based on the number of rotors on the platform. They are Tricopter (3 rotors), Quadcopter (4 rotors), Hexacopter (6 rotors) and Octocopter (8 rotors). Out of these, Quadcopters are the most popular and widely used variant.
